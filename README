Thanks to  dangiovannelli@gmail.com for coming up with this library. Does clean work on previous song.

Having used this library for couple of weeks, advanced features were needed. 

https://github.com/delannoyk/AudioPlayer is very good audio library with rewind and forward built in. Also the events are seamless.
